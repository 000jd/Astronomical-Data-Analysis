  <h1>Astronomy Data Analysis Course ðŸŒŒðŸ“Š</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Data Analysis Course! This repo is designed to provide an introduction to the basics of working with astronomical data, including image data, Integral Field Unit (IFU) data, tabular data, and neural networks. Each week will cover a different topic, and by the end of the repo, we will have a solid foundation in astronomy data analysis.</p>

## Week 1: Image Data ðŸ“·

This week will cover the basics of working with astronomical image data, including techniques for adjusting contrast, background estimation, and source extraction. By the end of the week, you will be able to:

- Understand how astronomical images are produced and what types of information they contain.
- Adjust the contrast of an image to reveal faint details.
- Estimate and remove background noise from an image.
- Identify and measure sources in an image, including deblending overlapping sources.

## Week 2: Integral Field Unit (IFU) Data ðŸŒˆ

This week will cover the basics of working with Integral Field Unit (IFU) data, which provides 2D maps of the spectrum of light from astronomical objects. By the end of the week, you will be able to:

- Understand how IFU data is produced and what types of information it contains.
- Extract spectra from IFU data and analyze them.
- Create visualizations of IFU data, including maps of emission line fluxes.

## Week 3: Tabular Data ðŸ“Š

This week will cover the basics of working with tabular data in astronomy, including the use of correlation functions and citizen science projects. By the end of the week, you will be able to:

- Understand how tabular data is used in astronomy and what types of information it contains.
- Calculate correlation functions to study the clustering of galaxies.
- Participate in citizen science projects to contribute to astronomical research.

## Week 4: Neural Networks ðŸ§ 

This week will cover the basics of using neural networks for astronomical data analysis, including the use of deep learning libraries like PyTorch. By the end of the week, you will be able to:

- Understand the basics of neural networks and how they can be applied to astronomy data.
- Train and evaluate a neural network for a specific task, such as galaxy classification.
- Use PyTorch to implement and train a neural network.
