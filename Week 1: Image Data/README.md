# Week 1: Image Data 🌌📷

## Overview 📚

This week covers the of working with astronomical image data, including techniques for adjusting contrast, background estimation, and source extraction.

## Topics 🧐

- Stretch Functions 🌟: A technique for adjusting the contrast of an image to reveal faint details.
- Astroquery 🌠: A Python package for querying astronomical databases, including those containing image data.
- Background Estimation 🌅: Estimating and removing background noise from astronomical images to reveal the true signal.
- Source Extraction 🔍: Identifying and measuring the properties of sources (stars, galaxies, etc.) in astronomical images, including methods for deblending overlapping sources.

## Required Python packages 🐍

- Astropy 🚀: A Python package for astronomy, including tools for working with FITS image data.
- Matplotlib 📈: A Python plotting library for creating visualizations of astronomical image data.
- Photutils 📸: A Python package for source extraction and photometry from astronomical images.
- Astroquery 🌠: A Python package for querying astronomical databases.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

- Understand how astronomical images are produced and what types of information they contain.
- Be able to adjust the contrast of an image to reveal faint details.
- Learn how to estimate and remove background noise from an image.
- Identify and measure sources in an image, including deblending overlapping sources.
