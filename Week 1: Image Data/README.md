# Week 1: Image Data

## **Overview**

This week will cover the basics of working with astronomical image data, including techniques for adjusting contrast, background estimation, and source extraction.

## **Topics**

- Stretch Functions: A technique for adjusting the contrast of an image to reveal faint details.
- Astroquery: A Python package for querying astronomical databases, including those containing image data.
- Background Estimation: Estimating and removing background noise from astronomical images to reveal the true signal.
- Source Extraction: Identifying and measuring the properties of sources (stars, galaxies, etc.) in astronomical images, including methods for deblending overlapping sources.

## **Required Python packages**

- Astropy: A Python package for astronomy, including tools for working with FITS image data.
- Matplotlib: A Python plotting library for creating visualizations of astronomical image data.
- Photutils: A Python package for source extraction and photometry from astronomical images.
- Astroquery: A Python package for querying astronomical databases.

## **Learning Objectives**

- Understand how astronomical images are produced and what types of information they contain.
- Be able to adjust the contrast of an image to reveal faint details.
- Learn how to estimate and remove background noise from an image.
- Identify and measure sources in an image, including deblending overlapping sources.
